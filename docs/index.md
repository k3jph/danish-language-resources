# Welcome

Welcome to _Danish Language Resources_.  This interactive document
is an evolving work that collects resources for English speakers
who are learning the Danish language.  I started this when I was
working through the Danish language course on
[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/course/da/en/Learn-Danish).
The Wordpress site where it was originally hosted suffered from
some bitrot, so I moved it over to a nice fresh
[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) site.

## Background

I started learning [Danish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language)
through [Duolingo](http://duolingo.com) in December 2014.  I had
spent a considerable effort throughout 2012 picking up
[German](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language) due to its
importance in the insurance industry and my dissertation studies.
But, like a lot of things, it got set aside.  I picked up German
again through Duolingo in November of 2014, but set it aside in
favor of Danish when it became available through the Android app.

I was motivated to learn Danish for sillier reasons.  We had just
booked a family vacation to Iceland.  Seeing that
[Icelandic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language) was
not available through Duolingo, Danish made some sense.  First,
Danish is compulsory for Icelandic students (as is English).  Further,
Icelandic and Danish are fairly closely related, so it might help.
This turned out well, since road signs and menus in Icelandic were
fairly intelligible after completing, roughly, two-thirds of the
Danish Duolingo course in three months.  [Norwegian
Bokmål](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokmål) might have made more
sense, but the course was not yet available.

This page exists to collect resources from around the Internet,
principally YouTube, to help students learning Danish and provide
a catalog for my own use.  Please feel free to [suggest additional
material](/contact-me/) or add it in the comments.
